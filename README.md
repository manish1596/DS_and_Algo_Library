# DS_and_Algo_Library
My implementation of standard data structures and algorithms in C/C++.
Many of these implementations are inspired by Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Lieserson, Rivest, Stein, while some were completed as part of lab assignments during the courses on Data Structures and Algorithms.
